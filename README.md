# India Global Index Visualization

> Visualizing India's global standing through HDI, GDP, governance, and more using real datasets and Python data science tools.

## 📊 India's Global Standing - Data-Driven Insights

### 🧠 Project Summary
This project presents an in-depth data analysis of India's position in global development and governance indices, using publicly available datasets. It focuses on key parameters like Human Development Index, GDP, public sector indicators, education, health, and more. The goal is to derive actionable insights through data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling.

### 📌 Project Highlights
- ✅ **No missing data hassles** - datasets were already clean
- 📊 **Combined multiple data formats** - CSV and Excel files
- 📈 **Storytelling through graphs** - visual insights that tell a story
- 🎓 **Beginner-friendly and scalable** - perfect for learning data science

## 📁 Datasets Used

### 1. Human Development Index (HDI)
- **File**: `Human_development_index (HDI).csv`
- **Source**: UNDP (United Nations Development Programme)
- **Description**: India's HDI scores across multiple years

### 2. Public Sector Indicators
- **File**: `publicsector_indicators.csv`
- **Source**: World Bank
- **Description**: Public sector performance indicators including government effectiveness, rule of law, and voice & accountability
